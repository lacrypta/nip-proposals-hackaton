# Nostr Optimizations for Modernized Advancements and Development

_Unleash the full potential of Nostr with NOMAD, a project aiming to revolutionize Nostr through a series of innovative NIPs that will reshape the decentralized landscape and create limitless possibilities._

---

Welcome to the NOMAD Project!
Our mission is to bring the Nostr protocol to new heights by introducing a set of transformative NIPs that enhance user experience, functionality, and versatility.

The NOMAD Project focuses on the following NIPs:

- **Immutable Badges:** we will establish a standard for issuing permanent badges that identify unique user attributes or achievements, fostering trust and credibility within the Nostr community.
  Two (not necessarily exclusive) alternative proposals are presented:
  - **[Immutable Badges](./nips/immutable-badges.md):** this NIP defines alternative creation, awarding, and profile-type events to deal with immutable badges that can deal with their mutable counterparts as well.
  - **[Immutable Badges Lite](./nips/immutable-badges-lite.md):** this NIP gives semantic meaning to the `.content` field of badge award events so as to realize a form of immutable badges.
- **[Ping / Pong Events](./nips/ping-pong.md):** these gentle reminders will encourage user engagement and interaction, enhancing the overall Nostr experience by prompting users to participate in discussions, share content, or explore new features.
- **[Multilingual External Identities in Profiles](./nips/multilingual-external-identities-in-profiles.md) (NIP-39 _bis_):** embrace Nostr's global community by supporting multiple languages in external identity claims.
  This NIP will make Nostr more inclusive and accessible to users worldwide.
- **[NIP-05 External Identity Claim](./nips/nip-05-external-identity-claim.md):** we'll implement a seamless way for users to establish their identity against one or more [NIP-05](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md) aliases, strengthening trust and connections within the Nostr network.
- **[Validators](./nips/validators.md):** our project will develop the foundation for creating stateful behavior in Nostr, unlocking a myriad of new functionalities and applications.
  These building blocks will pave the way for a more dynamic and interactive Nostr ecosystem.

Join the NOMAD Project at the Hackaton and help us bring Nostr to the forefront of decentralized innovation. Together, we'll create a brighter, more powerful future for the Nostr community.

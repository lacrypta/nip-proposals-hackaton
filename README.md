# NIP Proposals (2023 NOSTR Hackaton)

In this repository you'll find our NIP proposals.
These are:

- **[Immutable Badges](immutable-badges.md):** the purpose of this NIP is to provide immutable badge definitions that may not be changed once created.
- **[Multilingual External Identities in Profiles](multilingual-external-identities-in-profiles.md):** the purpose of this NIP is to provide a multilingual alternative to the proofs of [NIP-39](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/39.md).
- **[NIP-05 External Identity Claim](nip-05-external-identity-claim.md):** the purpose of this NIP is to provide means for users to establish their identity against one or more [NIP-05](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md) aliases.
- **[Ping / Pong Events](ping-pong.md):** the purpose of this NIP is to provide real-time, user-initiated, alerting from one user to one or more others, and back.
- **[Validators](validators.md):** the purpose of this NIP is to provide a framework for broadcasting immutable code blocks that will act as validators, and for specific events to declare which of these code blocks to use to validate itself.
